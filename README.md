# InforMeative - Inform me about the meat products that I buy

This is the repo for a project of Junction 2020 Hackathon. A web app with product-specific data showcasing sustainability, accessible through QR codes on product packages. A proof of concept for the hackathon.

The link to the application: https://junction-dashboard.azurewebsites.net/

Note that the website may not work. In that case, an option to try the app out is to clone the repo, install the Python packages required in `requirements.txt` (e.g., in a virtual environment), and do `python3 manage.py runserver` (Linux/macOS) or `python manage.py runserver` (Windows) on the command line in the project root directory and go to the link that appears after running the command.
